## Example 1 - Default Width Behavior

In CSS3 the option to change the way the box model handles it's total width has been introduced
in the box-sizing property.  The box-sizing property allows either content-box or box-sizing to be
set as its value, content-box is the default w3c box model and box-sizing, the IE model.

[From Sara Cope](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/box-sizing/)
> The box-sizing property in CSS controls how the box model is handled for the element it applies to.

Changing the box model is simple, for any selector, just use the box-sizing property.
