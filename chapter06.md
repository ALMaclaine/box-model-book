# Chapter 6 - In the wild

## But really, should I care?
For how well regarded and significant this trick seems to be, I've never had it shoved
in my face.  For significant this trick seems to be, and all the power it seemingly holds,
it doesn't make a lot of noise.

Whether this is a best kept secret, or just too mundane to mention, everyone taking design
seriously should at least be aware of the box-sizing reset.

So who is actually using the box-sizing reset in the wild?  Well perhaps you.
Every css framework I investigated used the box-sizing property to set border-box
at least one place.  However, the majority of the frameworks used the reset directly.
